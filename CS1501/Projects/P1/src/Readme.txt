INTRODUCTION

Cloth cutting problem is similar optimization problem as knapsack problem.
Basically, we have to use dynamic programming to solve one large problem by breaking into smaller subprobelms. 
So we have to find best strategy to get maximum optimal sum of smaller pieces of clothes.
Then, we have to display it graphically like the machine is actually cutting rectangular cloth into smaller subcloth.
My test file is almost exactly same as TestClothClutter.java that instructor gave.

INSTALLATION

The following files should be present:

     ClothCutter.java
     ClothGraphic.java
     Pattern.java
     Garment.java
     Cut.java
     TestClothCutter.java

USAGE

TestClothCutter is for example of usage. It is very similar to instructor's except I set width, height, pixel as different value. And I have ClothGraphic.java instead of Cloth.java.


PROBLEMS
It compiles and run in command line.
I guess there is none.
