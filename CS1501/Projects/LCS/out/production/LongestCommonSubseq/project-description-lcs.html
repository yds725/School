<hr><center><h3>Longest Common Subsequence</h3></center>

A <em>Longest Common Subsequence</em> (LCS) of two strings is exactly
what the name implies!  For instance, an LCS of the strings
<tt>haedlelfog</tt> and <tt>abchxeylzloabc</tt> is the string
<tt>hello</tt>.  Note that the characters of the LCS do not need to be
contiguous in either of the original strings.  Also, there may be
multiple LCS's.

<p>

It is simple to find an LCS of two strings recursively.  Suppose
that <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are strings, and <tt>c1</tt> and
<tt>c1</tt> are characters.  Define <tt>LCS(s1+c1,s2+c2)</tt> to be:
</p><ul>
  <li> <tt>LCS(s1,s2)+c1</tt> if <tt>c1==c2</tt>
  </li><li> <tt>LCS(s1+c1,s2)</tt> if <tt>c1!=c2</tt> and <tt>LCS(s1+c1,s2)&gt;LCS(s1,s2+c2)</tt>
  </li><li> <tt>LCS(s1,s2+c2)</tt> if <tt>c1!=c2</tt> and <tt>LCS(s1,s2+c2)&gt;LCS(s1+c1,s2)</tt>
</li></ul>
Of course, <tt>LCS(s1,empty)=LCS(empty,s2)=empty</tt>.

<p>

A straightforward recursive implementation of this definition would be
unusable, but a dynamic programming implementation should run in
quadratic time.  This is because for input strings <tt>s1</tt> and
<tt>s2</tt>, we need to complete a table with
<tt>length(s1)*length(s2)</tt> entries, where each entry requires us
to examine three previously computed entries and some simple
arithmetic.

You will write a class <tt>LCS</tt> in the file <tt>LCS.java</tt> with
the static method:
</p><pre>    public static String findLCS(String s1, String s2)
</pre>
that will find a longest common subsequence of two strings.  It should
run in less than ten seconds for strings up to length 100.  Your code
must work with my test file.  Also include a <tt>README.txt</tt> file.
