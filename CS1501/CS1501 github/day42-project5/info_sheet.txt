Additional comments to the grader:
I edited LargeInteger.java class a lot. I implemented all three methods XGCD multiply modular exponent 
and added many other methods. Tested XGCD with different test class, it successfully worked.
I implemented inverse modular function, GCD function so that I can just do easy calculation.
