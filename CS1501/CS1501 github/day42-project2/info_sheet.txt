Does your program run without error?: 
Yes; but it takes some time to compress since I did not remove substring() call

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:







Additional comments to the grader:
How do I improve this slow performance? I am not sure how to remove all calls to substring().
