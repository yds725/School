##Few Information you have to read
I could not pretty much do Game page part. (persisting data between servers)
I expect lots of points will be taken off as I just realize that Game part takes most of points.
Other micellanous part like landing page, other functionalities works fine. (I tried to complete other parts fully as possible)
Also, about 'devinit' I manually added things like turn, winner_id.
